	<p id="para">An internal stylesheet holds CSS rules for the page in the head section of the HTML file.</p>
	 <p>The rules only apply to that page, but you can configure CSS classes and IDs that can be used to style multiple elements in the page code.</p> <p>Again, a single change to the CSS rule will apply to all tagged elements on the page.</p>
