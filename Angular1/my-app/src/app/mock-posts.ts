    title: 'DIYouTube: Meet The Travel Guides Building A Brand On The Go', 
    content: 'A few years ago, I featured Damon Dominique and Jo Franco, two friends from college who had gained 440,000 subscribers on their YouTube travel channel called "Shut Up and Go." They grew because they offered a novel idea: To not simply portray travel life, but to live travel. By crossing borders and learning languages, they were encouraging the youth of the world to move around and meet. And as lively as they were, entertainment seemed secondary to the mission of teaching how to fulfill millennial wanderlust.'

    content: 'Dear Travel Troubleshooter: My husband and I arranged to fly my octogenarian mother for a visit to San Francisco for her birthday. We purchased a first-class ticket for my mom on Sun Country Airlines, not only for her comfort, but more importantly to assist her in the process of navigating through the airport and airport security. She has limited mobility and limited airline travel experience, and was flying solo. We purchased travel insurance to protect against possible travel interruptions.'

    title: 'How ‘Happy as Lazzaro’ and ‘In My Room’ Breathe New Life Into the Time Travel Trope', 
    content: 'From the beginning of Ulrich Köhler’s “In My Room,” the timing is already off. A cameraman, later revealed to be our middling protagonist Armin (Hans Löw), has mixed up his on and off buttons, leaving footage of a conference with all the meat missing. Just as a politician is about to speak, the image and sound cut out. “Good thing we didn’t miss that,” someone mistakenly says in the background. Too bad they did.'

    content: 'The Greek sovereign debt crisis will not repeat itself in Italy, Austrian Finance Minister Hartwig Loeger said in remarks published on Sunday. “The Italian economy has more substance than the Greek,” Loeger told the Handelsblatt newspaper. “And in Italy there have at least been some structural reforms, as opposed to Greece in the past. As such the Greek debt crisis will not repeat itself in Italy.” '
